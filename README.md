## Gameplay
Proceed through a series of puzzle stages with the end goal of reaching a demon girl. On each puzzle stage, push stones and skeleton soldiers, avoid spike traps and keep within a set moves limit.
* Each move reduces the remaining moves limit by 1
* Each stone push or skeleton push reduces the remaining moves limit by 1
* Each spike trap reduces the remaining moves limit by 2 (1 move + 1 extra)
